This was created as a school project. Yes I have uplaoded it to Github, this does not mean it is free to use
If you are considering plagirism remember that anything that your code can be compared to any existing code that 
 is up online. I don't condone cheating for school assignments. 
 
 Any mentions of what class this was for have been emoved from the code as a way to try to prevent others from using my code a
 s a form of cheating or plagirism. 
 
 This code was written in fall 2018 the only thing that has been changed since then is my removal of mentions to the 
 class the assignment was for. I cannot garentee that the google API or USGS JSON are still working as you are reading 
 this.
