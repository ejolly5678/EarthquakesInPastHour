This was created as a school project. Yes I have uploaded it to Github, this does not mean it is free to use for your school project.
If you are considering plagiarism on a school assignment, please don't.

Any mentions of what class this was for have been removed from the code as a way to try to prevent others from using my code for that class. The laziest way to cheat is to google "university + Class name" and I don't want to contribute to that. This is meant solely as a way to show employers code that I wrote that I am proud of.

This code was written in fall 2018 the only thing that has been changed since then is my removal of mentions to the
class the assignment was for. This was project4 of this class which is why the driver is named project4. When I get more time, I may get around to editing that. I cannot guarantee that the google API or USGS JSON are still working 100% the way I originally intended them to. Based on my initial tests, it seems to still be working. I cannot guarantee that they will in the future due to the nature of public APIs and JSONs. API links can change which would cause this no longer to work.

Thank you,
Liz Jolly
